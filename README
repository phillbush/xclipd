XCLIPD(1)                   General Commands Manual                  XCLIPD(1)

NAME
     xclipd â€“ clipboard manager daemon

SYNOPSIS
     xclipd

DESCRIPTION
     xclipd maintains the contents of the CLIPBOARD selection, making it
     possible to copy the contents of a window into the clipboard and to close
     that window without losing the copied content.

     xclipd also keeps the PRIMARY selection synchronized with the CLIPBOARD
     selection.  Whenever something is copied into the CLIPBOARD selection,
     that content can also be requested from the PRIMARY selection as well,
     but not the other way around.

     xclipd does not daemonize itself; therefore, it should be run in the
     background.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of xclipd.

     DISPLAY
             The display to start xclipd on.

BUGS
     xclipd does not support large selection contents and does not implement
     incremental selection transfer.

     xclipd only keeps textual content on the clipboard.  Images, audio and
     contents in other formats are not kept.

     xclipd requests textual contents from the original clipboard owner in its
     plain format; therefore, any textual markup is lost.  In normal
     conditions, copying a bold or italic text from a browser and pasting it
     into LibreOffice maintains the bold/italic markup, but pasting it into
     XTerm loses the markup (only the plain text is pasted).  However, xclipd
     only saves plain text; so in that example, the markup is lost both when
     copying into LibreOffice or into XTerm.  Consider that bug as a feature.

     There are probably other bugs.
